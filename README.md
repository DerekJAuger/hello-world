# hello-world
First ever repository

Hey everyone,
I decided to learn to code sometime around March 22nd, 2019. Today is March 31st and I decided to create a GitHub account. So far I have used freecodecamp to learn some basic HTML and CSS. I have also used Udacity to get an introduction to Javascript, although I'm putting that on hold until I feel more comfortable with HTML and CSS. I plan to land my first position in this new career within the next 1-3 months. Wish me luck!
